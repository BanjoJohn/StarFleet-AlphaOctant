 civic_social_contract:0 "Social Contract"
 civic_social_contract_desc:0 "The basic bargain that the Federation strikes with its citizens is called the Social Contract System. The principle is simple: anyone who is able-bodied and/or ableminded (and unable to find and hold a job in the private sector), who is willing to work 30 hours a week on community service projects, receives enough monetary compensation and support from society to have what is called the 'baseline' lifestyle: food, clothing, shelter, education, health care, and opportunities for leisure and entertainment."

Four years later, the United Federation of Planets was formed with the signing of the Federation Charter in San Francisco on Earth, bringing Earth, Vulcan, Alpha Centauri, Andor, and Rigel into a common framework.\n\n This paved the way to a unified government, founded on the principles of 'Development of friendly, equal relations among the member worlds, based on the principles of the Universal Equanimity of all Sentients and the right of self-determination for all peoples, to the achievement of mutal interstellar cooperation in the resolution of social, cultural, political, and economic concerns, and to serve as the center for harmonizing theactions of member species in the attainment of these common ends.'\n\n Eleven years later, the Federation is beginning to explore the galaxy in earnest, in interest of peace and diversity."
